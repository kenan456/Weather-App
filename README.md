# Weather Forecast - React Web App

A sleek and intuitive React web application that provides real-time weather information for cities around the world. The app leverages data from two powerful APIs — the **OpenWeatherMap API** and the **GeoDB Cities API** — to offer accurate weather forecasts and city search functionality.

## Features

- **City Search Autocomplete:** Enter a city name, and a dropdown menu will display cities that closely match your search prompt, thanks to the GeoDB Cities API.
- **Current Weather Data:** Displays real-time weather information for the selected city, including:
  - Temperature
  - Weather conditions (e.g., rain, clouds, etc.)
  - Wind and gust speeds
  - Humidity
  - Pressure
  - Visibility
- **5-Day Hourly Forecast:** Provides detailed weather data for the next 5 days, displayed hourly. The forecast includes:
  - Temperature
  - Weather conditions
  - Wind and gust speeds
  - Humidity
  - Pressure
  - Visibility

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **Vite:** For fast and optimized development.
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** To fetch current weather data and a 5-day hourly forecast.
- **GeoDB Cities API:** To fetch and autocomplete city names based on user input.

## Disclaimer
**Please note that the app uses the basic plan for the GeoDB Cities API, which limits the number of API requests. If a city doesn’t appear in the search results right away, I kindly request trying again after a moment**.
