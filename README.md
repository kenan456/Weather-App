# Weather App
A web app that uses OpenWeatherMap and GeoDB Cities APIs to display real-time weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, visibility, pressure, probability of precipitation, and a 5-day hourly forecast

## Quick Start
You can visit the app at "insert link". You will be greeted by the homepage, which is where you will be enter in a city name to get the weather data for that city. Unfortunately, **the app uses the basic plan for the GeoDB Cities API, and so if you type in a city name too quickly, your desired city may not appear in the drop down of city options, and I kindly request you enter in the city name again to get the desired city to appear in the drop down menu**.
