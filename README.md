# Weather App
A web app that utilizes the OpenWeatherMap and GeoDB Cities APIs to provide real-time weather data. It includes details such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, visibility, pressure, probability of precipitation, and a 5-day hourly forecast. This app offers a comprehensive view of current weather conditions and future forecasts.

## Quick Start and Usage
You can visit the app at [insert link]. On the homepage, enter a city name in the search bar to get weather data. **Please note that the app uses the basic plan for the GeoDB Cities API, which limits the number of API requests. If a city doesnâ€™t appear in the search results right away, I kindly request trying again after a moment**. To return to the homepage and search for a different city, click the yellow sun icon at the top.
